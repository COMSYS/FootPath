OTHER ISSUES
############

This software is currently a proof of concept. It needs some more work to make it generally useable for a non technical person.

Open issues include:
* Automatically downloading available indoor maps
* Better UI
* Looking at several possible paths at once.


HOW TO USE THIS SOFTWARE
########################
* Create your maps with JOSM and put them into the folder res/xml
    * NOTE: ways and nodes should have an attribute indoor=yes and a name
    * compare with our maps. (TODO)
* Change lines 199-204 in Loader.java to load your maps on startup 
* Run update-revfile.sh after every commit, so that log messages refer to the correct revision.
